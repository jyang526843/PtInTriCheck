## Introduction
To check points inside or outside a given 2D triangle, 3D tetrahedron, or an arbitrary DIM-dimensional simplex.
In geometry, a simplex is a generalization of the notion of a triangle or tetrahedron to arbitrary dimensions. 
E.g.: A 2D simplex is a triangle. A 3D simplex is a tetrahedral.
